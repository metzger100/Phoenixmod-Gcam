# For Users

  Like most other GitHubrepos we have a special site for you to submit problems, crashes and other Issues:
  [![issues - Phoenixmod-Gcam](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/metzger100/Phoenixmod-Gcam)](https://github.com/Metzger100/Phoenixmod-Gcam/issues)
  If you have an Issue please first check if there is already a open Issue for your Problem.
  If you open up a new Issue please provide a Crashlog an Screenshots/Screenrecords of it. You can't make logs please check the Article in the [Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E55pLmJXadr-eJ_C_5m84x3mT7XspnzRQn6FENZ1H0k/edit#bookmark=id.502ou73v2xfq) i made some time ago
  

# For Devs
  
  This repo is pure smali project so please code in smali please. For compilation I recommend to use [APKTool Easy](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-windows-apk-easy-tool-v1-59-2-2021-04-03.3333960/). 
  After smali-Projects are not easy to work with, I recommend to use Android Studio to code in Java compile it up to an apk. Then you decompile it with apktool and copy the smali code into the smali project.
  If you are new to Gcam or smali/gcammodding I have made some [Docs](https://gcamdocs.com/). Before this site I made some Googledocs and the I have not yet transferred this completely to the Webpage.
  The Gcamdocs are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E55pLmJXadr-eJ_C_5m84x3mT7XspnzRQn6FENZ1H0k/).
